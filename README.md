## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:
* [ ] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [ ] Custom font
* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] Automatically calculate the tax amount
- [ ] Design an icon for the app

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
The main challenge for me is to figure out basic concepts of Swift, such as the difference between Outlets and Actions.
The most intesting part is to make some simple animation.
